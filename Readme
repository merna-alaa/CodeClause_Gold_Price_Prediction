I created this project (gold price prediction) for CodeClause Data science intern on linkdin
I used gold orice dataset from kaggle 
I cleaned the data from missing or duplicated values
Then I visualized some features to see relationships between them and used heatmap to show correlation
I split the data into training and test sets
I applied Random forest and xgboost algorithm to see the error and get the predicted values vs the actual
I used google colab using python language.
